# Color-Quantization

**Color Quantization** is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image. Color quantization is critical for displaying images with many colors on devices that can only display a limited number of colors, usually due to memory limitations, and enables efficient compression of certain types of images.
In this project, I used **KMeans Clustering** algorithm in order to reduce the number of used colors in a **parrot image**.
The final parrot image has 6 colors, which means that the number of clusters in algorithm is 6.
